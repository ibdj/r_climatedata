  abstract = {Precipitation measured on two proximal guages located at the double masted climate station between Badesø and Langsø at 40 m a.s.l.. The timeseries starts in 2007. Data from station 653 are quality controlled and used as primary source for precipitation data. Data from station 652 are used to identify false pulses/precipitation on station 653, but not used in the final precipitation time series. Antifreeze and oil is added to the gauges to ensure correct measurements durin ghte winter. Note that the data series has not been corrected for the efficiency of the precipitation gauge in catching precipitation, which is especially a problem during winter snow fall that occurs along with heavy winds. Please read the metadata file provided with the data for comments related to the data in this timeseries. Precipitation:Precipitation ClimateBasis Nuuk:The ClimateBasis programme monitors climate and hydrology in Zackenberg, Kobbefjord and Disko (Qeqertarsuaq) and is run by Asiaq - Greenland Survey. The collected data build base-line information on climate variability and trends for all the other sub-programmes within GEM and serve as a trustworthy foundation for adaptation strategies for the Greenlandic society. The stations are embedded in Asiaq’s extensive climate and hydrology monitoring network. Furthermore, the run-off data is delivered to the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS) and the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) networks.},
